# Overview

Out of the box, Primo displays all of the 6xx fields regardless of indicators or source. This can lead to a lot of duplicate subject headings as well as foreign subject headings that are not in use by an institution. The end result can be an unnecessarily cluttered Full Record Display.

# Solution 
>*(Does not apply to MESH headings as these are in a different out-of-the-box display heading)*  

>*The solution is still in progress. Affects 650 and 655 as of 10/2022*

Produces a display for subject access fields that come from the following thesauruses: 
- Library of Congress Subject Headings (0)
- LC subject headings for children's literature (1)
- National Agricultural Library subject authority file (3)
- Source not specified (4)
- FAST headings (indicator 2 = 7; $2 = fast)

> 4 and 7 may need to be revised to exclude or include desired thesauruses.

**Excludes**  

- Medical Subject Headings (2) 
  - (this is handled in a different display rule)
- Canadian Subject Headings (5)
- Répertoire de vedettes-matière (6)  

> This process can theoretically be used to suppress similarly duplicated genre forms from the display.

## Installation instructions 

In Alma Configuration, navigate to: Discovery > Display Configuration > Manage Display and Local Fields

- Add Field 
- Add Display Field
- Select Field to edit
- Edit MARC21 normalization rule for display
- Find the code you want to replace. Delete desired default code 
  - (you can always get it back by selecting "restore default")
- Paste the new normalization code
- Save
- Click Back
- Select Apply Rules 
  - **(THIS IS IMPORTANT. Changes will not update in Primo until the rules have been applied. Once the rules are applied, changes are immediate.)**



## Normalization Code

> The Subject display normalization rule is comprised of *many* individual rules. It is extremely large. Only the modified rules will be added here at this time. You must find and replace the individual rules you want to modify.  



### 650  

```

### 655
